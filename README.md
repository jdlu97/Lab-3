# Lab 03: Real-Time Scheduler
 This repository contains the source code and documentation for Lab 3 of ME 405 (Mechatronics) course at California Polytechnic State University.
 
 In this laboratory exercise, we integrated the code developed in the previous week into a real-time scheduler and tested its performance. 
 
 First, we started running the controller task at a 10-ms period and with a proportional gain value of 0.03. The step response plot is shown below (**Figure 1**).
